Missing File Sync
Gad Berger, 11/26/2011

A simple python script to update a folder with missing folders and files.

Usage: python missingfilesync.py [sourcefolder] [destfolder]

Only new files and folders are copied over.
It was originally intended to keep Amazon MP3 purchases synced across a home
server, SD card and other devices. However, it was general enough to be used
for any other purpose.

Enjoy!
